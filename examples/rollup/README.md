This is a simple app that renders the embedded payments component and loads the connect-js script using this npm package. Use this app to test out the library.

## Replace the following variables

Ensure that you have replaced the following placeholders in the downloaded code sample:

- `{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`
- `pk_INSERT_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `sk_INSERT_YOUR_SECRET_KEY`

## Running the sample

1. Build the server

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Compile and run the server

```
Run 
yarn install # installs all packages
yarn start # runs rollup to compile and starts the server
```

3. Go to [http://localhost:4242/index.html](http://localhost:4242/index.html)

Note: if you are doing local development, you can use yalc to test local changes

1. yarn build # from the root of this repository
1. yalc publish # from the root of this repository
2. yalc add @stripe/connect-js # in this sample
3. Repeat this process whenever there are any changes to the package
